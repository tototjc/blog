# Astro-Blog

Currently in development...

I'm building a lightweight blog program for personal use. This project will never support server-side rendering and will minimize reliance on client-side JavaScript.

## Todo

- [ ] load markdown file from online github repo
- [ ] pwa
- [ ] katex in decap preview
- [ ] post tag

Additional features are still being considered...
